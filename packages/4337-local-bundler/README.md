# ERC-4337 Local Bundler

This repository contains tools for setting up and using a local ERC-4337 bundler for testing. While on-chain compatibility with the ERC-4337 `EntryPoint` contract is important, arguably the most challenging part of being compatible with the standard is ensuring that the account follows the user operation validation and account deployment rules that are enforced by the off-chain bundlers. As such, this repository provides tools to run a local development node with the reference ERC-4337 bundler for testing purposes.
